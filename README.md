# üß†Cyber-Brain
The initial project was to create a replica of the human brain using everything from atoms to neural networks, in order to discover how far this "cyber-brain" can go in matters of data processing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èNews
However, due to lack of equipment, the project was halted,
A plan is currently being developed to restart or start from scratch the project with a new software architecture and appropriate equipment.

## Goal
The objective of the project is for this virtual brain to be made in c++, proving the efficiency of the low-level language in highly complex projects.
